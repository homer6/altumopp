
[section Examples]

The examples can be built by going into their directory and typing `bjam`. If you have a server set up and wish to test the applications behind them, you can automatically copy them to your server's cgi-bin or fcgi-bin one of two ways:

[h4 Command Line]

``shell> bjam install --cgi-bin=/usr/lib/cgi-bin``

Installs the CGI program (or set of programs) into `/usr/lib/cgi-bin`. If you want to install FastCGI examples from the `/libs/cgi/example/fcgi/` directory, for instance, type the above but replace `--cgi-bin=...` with `--fcgi-bin=...`.

[h4 Environment Variables]

Set the environment variable(s) `BOOST_CGI_BIN_PATH` or `BOOST_FCGI_BIN_PATH`, then type:

``shell> bjam install``

The example(s) will be installed into the relevant directory.

[note
  The command line option will override the environment variable, so you can use the environment variables for default installation.
