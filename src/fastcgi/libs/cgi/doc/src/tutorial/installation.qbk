[section Installation]

Boost.CGI is a header-only library so there is no source to build. However, the library depends on a few Boost libraries (listed below), which for now should be built. Support for sessions also adds Boost.Serialization as a dependency.

[h5 Dependencies]

* Boost C++ Libraries. Tested with v1.39-v1.42. Session support requires Boost.Uuid, which was first included in v1.42[footnote The version of Boost.Uuid in Boost 1.42 reportedly does not create truly random Uuids, so you are recommended to use the version of Boost.Uuid distributed with Boost 1.43 or above.]
* Google cTemplate - only required for using stencils (optional).

[h5 Preparing]

Boost-related elements can be downloaded from the [@http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586 Boost download site] at sourceforge.

[note
"invoking `bjam`" implies calling "`bjam toolset=<your_toolset>`", where "`<your_toolset>`" is one of [@http://www.boost.org/doc/html/bbv2/reference.html#bbv2.reference.tools.compilers these]. More information can be found [@http://boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html here] (these are general instructions for building Boost [*and] configuring `bjam`. Following these instructions will also 'tick' the first two requirements below.

[table What you need
  [[Element] [Optional?] [Instructions]]
  [
   [Boost.Jam - `bjam`]
   [No]
   [Download '__boost_jam__' (precompiled versions are highly recommended) and make it accessible to your system's PATH.]
  ]
  [
   [Boost.System / Boost.Filesystem / Boost.Regex / Boost.Thread / Boost.Date_time]
   [No]
   [1. Download the latest Boost distro, 'boost'.

   2. Set the environment variable BOOST_ROOT on your system to the download location.

   3. Go to the directory BOOST_ROOT and invoke `bjam` (see above), passing it `--with-system --with-regex --with-date_time --with-filesystem --build-type=complete install` on the command line. his should finish without any failures.
   
   For complete instructions, see the [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html Boost Getting Started guide].]

  [
   [Documentation]
   [Yes]
   [These are built by going to the libs/cgi/doc directory and invoking `bjam` (see above). You can then read the docs by directing your browser to libs/cgi/index.html]
  ]
  [
   [Unit tests]
   [Yes]
   [Tests can be run by going to the libs/cgi/test directory and invoking `bjam` (see above). Boost.CGI aims to be cross-platform, but not all platforms are available for testing. If any tests fail, problems can be reported to [link __reporting_problems__ here].]
  ]
  [
   [Examples]
   [Yes]
   [There are some examples provided with the library in the `libs/cgi/example` directory. They are useful for learning the library or testing your server configuration, something that can be tricky. They can all be found in the lib/cgi/example directory. Invoking `bjam` in the example directory should build all examples whereas invoking `bjam` in each sub-directory will build only the example contained therein.]
