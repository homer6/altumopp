[tip Have you read __reading_the_docs__?]

This section of the documentation is probably best read before the __tutorial__. In a nutshell, this is a quick and dirty run-through of how to get and install the library and configure your server. Following that is a short example of a CGI program and one of a FastCGI program, just to highlight the features of the library.

Don't worry if you don't understand these examples, as the __tutorial__ that follows this section explains everything.
