Depending on what protocol you plan on using, you should include one of the following headers:

``
#include <boost/cgi.hpp>      // include header files for any protocol

#include <boost/cgi/cgi.hpp>  // include all headers required for CGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/fcgi.hpp> // include all headers required for FastCGI usage
``
