[section:accepting Accepting Requests]

A [classref cgi::basic_request_acceptor `basic_request_acceptor<>`] is responsible for accepting requests. The following `typedefs` are provided for typical use:
``
acgi::acceptor // aCGI
fcgi::acceptor // FastCGI
scgi::acceptor // SCGI
``

Note: `cgi::request` cannot be used with an acceptor, but an `acgi::request` will work fine: ie. only the first accept will succeed. A program written for SCGI or FastCGI will generally have an acceptor running in a loop.

Accepting requests is considered distinct to the [link __loading__ loading] stage for several reasons, the most significant of which is to allow for multiplexing protocols like FastCGI work with the other protocols.

A `basic_request_acceptor<>` takes an instance of a __ProtocolService__ in its constructor. The following member functions are available (take xcgi to imply one of fcgi/scgi/acgi):

[table
  [[Function signature] [Purpose]]
  [
    [`void accept(xcgi::request& empty_request)`]
    [Takes an empty request and blocks until a request is waiting to be handled. This will throw if the accept fails.]
  ]
  [
    [`boost::system::error_code&
    accept(xcgi::request& empty_request, boost::system::error_code& ec)`]
    [Takes an empty request and blocks until a request is waiting to be handled. `ec` will be set such that `!ec == false` if the accept fails with an error code `ec`.]
  ]
  [
    [`void async_accept(xcgi::request& empty_request, Handler handler)`]
    [Takes an empty request and asynchronously accepts a request. `handler` must be a model of __Handler__ and will be invoked when a request is accepted or an error occurs. The function always returns immediately.]
  ]
  [
    [`void cancel()`]
    [Cancel all outstanding asynchronous accepts that are running]
  ]

[h5 Example]

``
#include <boost/cgi/scgi.hpp>
#include <boost/system/error_code.hpp>

int main()
{
  using namespace cgi::scgi; // for example

  // create a ProtocolService
  service service;

  // create an acceptor
  acceptor acceptor(service);

  // make an empty request
  request req(service);

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  // accept a request
  acceptor.accept(req, ec);

  if (!ec)
  {
    // a request was accepted ok
  }

  return 0;
}
