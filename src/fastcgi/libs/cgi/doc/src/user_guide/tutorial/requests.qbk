[section Request Objects]

The class [classref cgi::basic_request `cgi::basic_request<>`] is the main entry point to the library. The following `typedef`s are provided for typical usage:
``
cgi::request // CGI -- note: this would be cgi::cgi::request fully-qualified
acgi::request // aCGI
fcgi::request // FastCGI
scgi::request // SCGI
``

The `cgi::request` is a bit different to the other types, in that it doesn't need to be constructed with a __ProtocolService__. This simplification makes it ideal for, and its use is detailed in, the  '[link __scripting__ scripting]' quickstart. The other request types, however, have a distinct advantage in that they provide you with asynchronous functions.
