[section:what_next The next step]

Now we have a "Hello world" example compiling and working with our server we can choose to do two things:

* Make a CGI program that handles user-supplied data to provide dynamic content, or

* Turn the CGI "Hello world" into a FastCGI "Hello world", allowing better scalability.

The first option is of course what CGI is all about: you take form data or a query string or a user's cookies and serve a custom response. The second option isn't mutually exclusive to the first, it is essentially an 'extra step' that you should be able to do at any point in the life-cycle of your application - although the sooner you do it the easier it might be!

[important
  Once you have set up an `fcgi::request`, you use it in almost exactly the same way as a `cgi::request`.
