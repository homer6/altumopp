[section `basic_request<>`: Request Objects]

The template class `basic_request<>` is the most useful class in the library.

There are `typedef`s for typical usage, following usual __naming_styles__:

[table Request typedefs
 [[Protocol] [`typedef`     ]]
 [[CGI     ] [`boost::cgi::request` ]]
 [[FastCGI ] [`boost::fcgi::request`]]
 [[SCGI    ] [`boost::scgi::request`]]
]
