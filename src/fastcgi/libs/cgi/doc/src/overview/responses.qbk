['[*TODO]: Document using Responses]

While you may sometimes want to respond to a request by writing directly back to the client, more often that not it is preferable to buffer your response. You can never tell how successful a request is going to be from the start, or whether an exception is going to be throw. Being able to rewrite your response at any time is a requirement for real-world applications.

The library provides the [classref boost::cgi::response response] class to make buffering your response simpler.

[tip
  If you're keen to use HTML templates, consider looking at the [classref boost::cgi::stencil stencil] class, which uses Google's cTemplate library to allow you to write
maintainable [@http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%2Dview%2Dcontroller Model-View-Controller] apps. This class is just a lightweight wrapper over cTemplate and is [*currently experimental].
