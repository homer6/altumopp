 * Include this file into your project to compile the library "in-place".
 *
 * If you're using Boost.Jam, the library can be built by specifying
 * "--build-cgi" on the command line.
 *
 * eg.
 *    libs/cgi/build$ bjam --build-cgi               (builds the library)
 *
 *    libs/cgi/example$ bjam --build-cgi install
 *
 *        (builds and installs all the examples using the compiled binary
 *         - which will be installed if necessary - see the docs for more)
