// need to use wide characters. We'll keep everything as narrow characters
// and pass the 'char' type along to the Fastcgipp::Request template.

		// out.dump(basic_istream<char>& stream); or
		// out.dump(char* data, size_t size);

		// while waiting for a reply. Passing messages to requests through the
